img3875,Beginning of the Journey at Dusseldorf International Airport,Burak Celikpence,44878,"It was the beginning of our trip to Rome. We bought flight tickets from Eurowings, and the price was not expensive. The tickets cost 100euro per person for going and coming back. Dusseldorf International Airport is really nice place, easy to reach via trains.",airports,Dusseldorf,51.2876146,6.764216,Own Archive,img3875,Image,image/jpeg,eng,,,image,/objects/img3875.JPG,/objects/small/img3875_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/img3875_th.jpg
img3900,The View of Nest,Burak Celikpence,44879,"This was the view from our room. Waking up to this scenery and enjoying an espresso made us feel like true Italians! The location of 'the Golden Rooms' was amazing, just a 10-minute walk from the Spanish Steps at a leisurely pace. While the room was a bit expensive for a student budget, it was definitely worth it.",hotel rooms,Rome,41.904562,12.4811492,Own Archive,img3900,Image,image/jpeg,eng,,,image,/objects/img3900.JPG,/objects/small/img3900.jpg,/objects/thumbs/img3900.jpg
img3913,A Classic Photo from Fontana di Trevi,Burak Celikpence,44879,"Our starting point was the Trevi Fountain, as millions of visitors before us have done. Despite it being our first time in Rome, our visit was quite memorable as the fountain was empty of water. We later discovered that Rome Municipality cleans the Trevi once a month. While it wasn't a big deal, it did give us a chance to view the fountain in a unique way and, perhaps, a sign of good luck. When you travel to a new place, you often want to experience the local culture.",fountains,"Rome, Piazza Trevi",41.9008832,12.4831492,Own Archive,img3913,Image,image/jpeg,eng,,,image,/objects/img3913.JPG,/objects/small/img3913_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/img3913_th.jpg
img3925,Another Perspective,Burak Celikpence,44879,"The Trevi Fountain is truly impressive. I admired the sculpture and the artistry behind it. In the center, we see the god Oceanus accompanied by Abundance and Health. Although the fountain is always crowded, visiting around 8:00 am in the winter allows for a less crowded viewing experience and more time to appreciate this fascinating piece.",sculptures,"Rome, Piazza Trevi",41.9008832,12.4831492,Own Archive,img3925,Image,image/jpeg,eng,,,image,/objects/img3925.JPG,/objects/small/img3925_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/img3925_th.jpg
